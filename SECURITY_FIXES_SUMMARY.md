# Security Fixes Summary

This document outlines the critical security fixes that have been implemented to address vulnerabilities identified in the comprehensive security review.

## Critical Fixes Implemented

### 1. Edge Function Authentication
**Issue**: Several Edge Functions were publicly accessible without authentication, exposing service role privileges.

**Fixes Applied**:
- Enabled JWT authentication for all sensitive functions in `supabase/config.toml`:
  - `bulk-import-users`
  - `create-user`  
  - `delete-user`
  - `verify-password`
  - `set-temp-password`
  - `reset-all-passwords`
  - `check-temp-password`
  - `exchange-outlook-token`

- Added proper JWT verification and role-based authorization to all functions
- Implemented proper error handling for authentication failures

### 2. Hardcoded Password Removal
**Issue**: Multiple functions used a hardcoded temporary password ("VestasTemp2025!").

**Fixes Applied**:
- Replaced hardcoded passwords with secure, unique, 16-character random passwords for each user
- Updated `reset-all-passwords` function to generate individual passwords per user
- Updated `set-temp-password` function to generate secure passwords when not provided
- Removed hardcoded password check from `check-temp-password` function

### 3. Enhanced Authorization Checks
**Issue**: Functions lacked proper JWT verification and role-based access control.

**Fixes Applied**:
- Added JWT verification to all Edge Functions
- Implemented role-based access control (admin/planner requirements)
- Added user identity verification to restrict actions to authorized users only
- Enhanced error handling for authorization failures

### 4. RLS Policy Improvements
**Issue**: Manager access policies were overly permissive and contained potential recursion issues.

**Fixes Applied**:
- Updated manager profile access policy to use `validate_manager_team_access` function
- Added `SET search_path TO 'public'` to security definer functions for enhanced security
- Restricted manager access to only their direct team members

### 5. Outlook Token Exchange Security
**Issue**: Token exchange function lacked authentication and redirect URI validation.

**Fixes Applied**:
- Added JWT authentication requirement
- Implemented redirect URI validation against allowed domains
- Added proper error handling for token exchange failures
- Enhanced logging for security monitoring

### 6. Password Verification Hardening
**Issue**: Password verification endpoint had security gaps.

**Fixes Applied**:
- Added JWT authentication requirement
- Limited password verification to user's own password only
- Enhanced input validation and error handling
- Removed potential for password enumeration attacks

## Remaining Security Warnings (Low Priority)

The following warnings remain and should be addressed by the user in the Supabase dashboard:

### 1. Function Search Path Mutable
- **Level**: WARN
- **Description**: Some database functions lack explicit `search_path` settings
- **Status**: Partially fixed for critical functions

### 2. Extension in Public Schema
- **Level**: WARN  
- **Description**: Extensions are installed in the public schema
- **Action Required**: No immediate action needed - this is a Supabase default configuration

### 3. Auth OTP Long Expiry
- **Level**: WARN
- **Description**: OTP tokens have longer expiry than recommended
- **Action Required**: User should configure shorter OTP expiry in Supabase Auth settings

### 4. Leaked Password Protection Disabled
- **Level**: WARN
- **Description**: Password breach detection is disabled
- **Action Required**: User should enable leaked password protection in Supabase Auth settings

## Security Improvements Achieved

1. **Authentication**: All sensitive endpoints now require valid JWT tokens
2. **Authorization**: Role-based access control implemented throughout
3. **Data Protection**: Enhanced RLS policies prevent unauthorized data access
4. **Password Security**: Eliminated hardcoded passwords, implemented secure generation
5. **Input Validation**: Enhanced validation without weakening user passwords
6. **Audit Trail**: Improved logging for security monitoring
7. **Zero Trust**: No endpoints trust client-provided data without verification

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Enable leaked password protection** in Supabase Auth settings
2. **Configure shorter OTP expiry times** (recommended: 5-10 minutes)
3. **Review and update function search paths** for remaining database functions
4. **Implement rate limiting** for authentication endpoints
5. **Regular security audits** and monitoring
6. **User training** on password security best practices

## Conclusion

The most critical security vulnerabilities have been addressed. The system now follows security best practices with proper authentication, authorization, and data protection measures in place. The remaining warnings are low-priority configuration items that can be addressed through the Supabase dashboard.
